I was blessed to be able to get to be able to get into the coop course and extremely blessed to work with such great people at my placement.

          Hi Future Me, I don't know if you would bother coming back to this or not but I will take a gamble that you will come back to this and remember the experiences that made you who you are today. I just want to remind you of how great of an experience you had and why you shouldn't give up on your dream to become a programmer. I spent time and effort learning things like Java, Eclipse, HTML, and CSS so continue perservering and forge the path to becoming a programmer. I of all people know how lazy you are and how much of a slacker you can be. Trust me this project was procrastinated and pushed back for a while. I'm sure that technology will evolve further when you see this so I hope you can keep the same motivation that we had when we started. I know that when you see this website you may think it's bad or trash but always remember this is our stepping stone to programming. P.S I know you will stop exersising, or have already stopped when you seen this so stop kidding yourself and get excersing don't quit because once you do it will be hard to gain what you lost. Also keep in touch with our friends. They are the true ones that got your back, so don't lose them.

            If you are reading this you probably know the jist about me, a guy, somewhere denfinitly under 6ft, and pretty lazy. I am Pavi, Pavi Vijeyarajah and I am a proud student of MCI. I have all sorts of hobbies such as playing basketball, soccer, hockey, videogames, building things, breaking things, blaming broken things on others, you get the idea. I consider myself to be a computer alcoholic because my computer is something I will keep coming back to rain or shine. I have a passion for building things and working with my hands and a passion for computers and programming. I am most likely going to attempt to build a robot with the expertise I will have in the future. What is most important to me is the safety of my family and friends because without them I am just some guy. You may not know just by looking but I am a huge I mean <b>HUGE</b> fan of Calliou and the Calliou franchise, especially Gilbert the Cat.
